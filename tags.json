Sure, you can use a Mineflayer bot to learn a language, but unless you are proficient in other languages it is not a beginner task.\n\nA Mineflayer bot consists of many different moving parts with varying degrees of complexity. As a developer you must be able to _understand_ these components.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a programmer or writing Mineflayer bots in the future it is highly recommend learning the language to an intermediate level beforehand.\n\nTo fully learn the language, you can take a look at the respective channel here and look for resources in the message pins and/or channel topic. \n\nWhy am I asking you to learn the language properly?\n Look at <https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/258208> for the reason why.",
