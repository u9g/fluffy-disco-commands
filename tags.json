  "jsfirst": "**If you are writing a Mineflayer bot for the first time please read the following**\nA Mineflayer bot is not a simple task. Sure, you can use a Mineflayer bot to learn a language, but unless you are proficient in other languages it is not a beginner task.\n\nA Mineflayer bot consists of many different moving parts with varying degrees of complexity. As a developer you must be able to _understand_ these components.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a programmer or writing Mineflayer bots in the future it is highly recommend learning the language to an intermediate level beforehand.\n\nTo fully learn the language, you can take a look at:\n- <https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md>\n- <https://javascript.info/>\n- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript> \n\nWhy am I asking you to learn the language properly?\n Look at <https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/258208> for the reason why.",
